# Project-2 - CRUD App

## "Whats on Melbourne?"

The app that I can created for project two is called Whats on Melbourne?. You can access the working game [here](https://whatsonmelbourne.herokuapp.com/). 


The app has the ability for two different kinds of logins, one for event organisers and one for users. Event organisers are able to upload new events, edit their events, and delete their events. They are also able to answer questions that are posed by users. Users can add events to their event list and they are able to pose questions to event organisers. If there is no login, the list of events still appears but they can't be added to a list. 

## Challenges 

* Image uploading and rendering in the correct size and proportions
* Form inputs - date and time
* Editing images 
* CSS animation on links

## Cool Tech

* Event organiser can update all of their event details
* Users can send event organiser an email through a link on the page
* Users can ask questions of the event organiser, if their quesiton is yet to be answered it will display under "questions yet to be answered", however these unanswered questions will not display to other users

## Databases

I have 5 different tables for this app; event_organisers, events, users, users_event_juntion, and questions.

## Unsolved problems

There are a few features that I would have liked to add to this project: 

* Break up events by month, ideally I would like to create pagination on the index page so that only the events for the current month are displayed. Links at the bottom of the page would take the user to the next or the previous month

* Better design, I would like to improve the visual design of the app

* I would have liked to create the ability for both users and event organisers to change their details
